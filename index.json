Initially there isn't a way to categorize notes added for Findings. Admin can introduce a new attribute to notes as 'note-type' which can categorize notes. To enable note-types go to System Settings, select Note Types and add new note-types to Dojo.\n Note-type  A note-type has 4 attributes.\n Name Description is_active - This has to be true to assign the note-type to a note. is_single - If true, only one note of that note-type can exist for a Finding. is_mandatory - If true, a Finding has to have at least one note from the note-type in order to close it.    If note-types are enabled, User has to first select the note-type from the \u0026quot;Note Type\u0026quot; drop down and then add the contents of the note.\n Images  Image(s) / Screenshot(s) related to the flaw.\n  SAST specific For SAST, when source (start of the attack vector) and sink (end of the attack vector) information are available.\n Line  Source line number of the attack vector.\n Line Number  Deprecated will be removed, use line.\n File Path  Identified file(s) containing the flaw.\n SAST Source Object  Source object (variable, function...) of the attack vector.\n SAST Sink Object  Sink object (variable, function...) of the attack vector.\n SAST Source line  Source line number of the attack vector,\n SAST Source File Path  Source file path of the attack vector.\n  Images  Images  Finding images can now be uploaded to help with documentation and proof of vulnerability.\n  If you are upgrading from an older version of DefectDojo, you will have to complete the following and make sure [MEDIA_ROOT]{.title-ref} and [MEDIA_URL]{.title-ref} are properly configured:\nAdd imagekit to INSTALLED_APPS:\nINSTALLED_APPS = ( 'django.contrib.auth', 'django.contrib.contenttypes', 'django.contrib.sessions', 'django.contrib.sites', 'django.contrib.messages', 'django.contrib.staticfiles', 'polymorphic', # provides admin templates 'overextends', 'django.contrib.admin', 'django.contrib.humanize', 'gunicorn', 'tastypie', 'djangobower', 'auditlog', 'dojo', 'tastypie_swagger', 'watson', 'tagging', 'custom_field', 'imagekit', )  Add [r'^media/']{.title-ref} to `LOGIN_EXEMPT_URLS`:\nLOGIN_EXEMPT_URLS = ( r'^static/', r'^api/v1/', r'^ajax/v1/', r'^reports/cover$', r'^finding/image/(?P\u0026lt;token\u0026gt;[^/]+)$' )  Then run the following commands (make sure your virtual environment is activated):\npip install django-imagekit pip install pillow --upgrade ./manage.py makemigrations dojo ./manage.py makemigrations ./manage.py migrate  New installations will already have finding images configured.\nFindings are listed on the /finding/open, /finding/closed, /finding/accepted and /finding/all pages. They can be filtered by their attributes as well as sorted by their Name, Date, Reviewed Date, Severity and Product.\n|\n|\n|\nVisual representation of a Finding:\nDeduplication / Similar findings  Automatically Flag Duplicate Findings  'De-duplication' is a feature that when enabled will compare findings to automatically identify duplicates. To enable de-duplication go to System Settings and check Deduplicate findings. Dojo deduplicates findings by comparing endpoints, CWE fields, and titles. If two findings share a URL and have the same CWE or title, Dojo marks the less recent finding as a duplicate. When deduplication is enabled, a list of deduplicated findings is added to the engagement view. The following image illustrates the option deduplication on engagement and deduplication on product level:\n  Similar Findings Visualization:\n Similar Findings  While viewing a finding, similar findings within the same product are listed along with buttons to mark one finding a duplicate of the other. Clicking the \u0026quot;Use as original\u0026quot; button on a similar finding will mark that finding as the original while marking the viewed finding as a duplicate. Clicking the \u0026quot;Mark as duplicate\u0026quot; button on a similar finding will mark that finding as a duplicate of the viewed finding. If a similar finding is already marked as a duplicate, then a \u0026quot;Reset duplicate status\u0026quot; button is shown instead which will remove the duplicate status on that finding along with marking it active again.\n  Metrics DefectDojo provides a number of metrics visualization in order to help with reporting, awareness and to be able to quickly communicate a products/product type's security stance.\nThe following metric views are provided:\n Product Type Metrics  This view provides graphs displaying Open Bug Count by Month, Accepted Bug Count by Month, Open Bug Count by Week, Accepted Bug Count by Week as well as tabular data on Top 10 Products by bug severity, Detail Breakdown of all reported findings, Opened Findings, Accepted Findings, Closed Findings, Trending Open Bug Count, Trending Accepted Bug Count, and Age of Issues.\n Product Type Counts  This view provides tabular data of Total Current Security Bug Count, Total Security Bugs Opened In Period, Total Security Bugs Closed In Period, Trending Total Bug Count By Month, Top 10 By Bug Severity, and Open Findings. This view works great for communication with stakeholders as it is a snapshot in time of the product.\n Simple Metrics  Provides tabular data for all Product Types. The data displayed in this view is the total number of S0, S1, S2, S3, S4, Opened This Month, and Closed This Month.\n Engineer Metrics  Provides graphs displaying information about a tester's activity.\n Metrics Dashboard  Provides a full screen, auto scroll view with many metrics in graph format. This view is great for large displays or \u0026quot;Dashboards.\u0026quot;\n  Users DefectDojo users inherit from django.contrib.auth.models.User.\nA username, first name, last name, and email address can be associated with each. Additionally the following describe the type of use they are:\n Active  Designates whether this user should be treated as active. Unselect this instead of deleting accounts.\n Staff status  Designates whether the user can log into this site.\n Superuser status  Designates that this user has all permissions without explicitly assigning them.\n  Calendar The calendar view provides a look at all the engagements occurring during the month displayed. Each entry is a direct link to the Engagement view page.\nNotifications DefectDojo can inform you of different events in a variety of ways. You can be notified about things like an upcoming engagement, when someone mentions you in a comment, a scheduled report has finished generating, and more.\nThe following notification methods currently exist: - Email - Slack - Microsoft Teams - Alerts within DefectDojo\nYou can set these notifications on a global scope (if you have administrator rights) or on a personal scope. For instance, an administrator might want notifications of all upcoming engagements sent to a certain Slack channel, whereas an individual user wants email notifications to be sent to the user's specified email address when a report has finished generating.\nMicrosoft Teams does not provide an easy way to send messages to a personal channel. Therefore, DefectDojo can only send system scope notifications to Microsoft Teams.\nIn order to identify and notify you about things like upcoming engagements, DefectDojo runs scheduled tasks for this purpose. These tasks are scheduled and run using Celery beat, so this needs to run for those notifications to work. Instructions on how to run Celery beat are available in the Reports section.\nBenchmarks DefectDojo utilizes the OWASP ASVS Benchmarks to benchmark a product to ensure the product meets your application technical security controls. Benchmarks can be defined per the organizations policy for secure development and multiple benchmarks can be applied to a product.\nBenchmarks are available from the Product view. To view the configured benchmarks select the dropdown menu from the right hand drop down menu. You will find the selection near the bottom of the menu entitled: 'OWASP ASVS v.3.1'.\nIn the Benchmarks view for each product, the default level is ASVS Level\n On the top right hand side the drop down can be changed to the desired ASVS level (Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3). The publish checkbox will display the ASVS score on the product page and in the future this will be applied to reporting.  On the left hand side the ASVS score is displayed with the desired score, the % of benchmarks passed to achieve the score and the total enabled benchmarks for that AVSV level.\nAdditional benchmarks can be added/updated in the Django admin site. In a future release this will be brought out to the UI.\nReports Reports can be generated for:\n Product types Products Engagements Tests List of Findings Endpoints Custom reports  Filtering is available on all report generation views to aid in focusing the report for the appropriate need.\nCustom reports, generated with the Report Builder, allow you to select specific components to be added to the report. These include:\n Cover Page Table of Contents WYSIWYG Content Findings Vulnerable Endpoints Page Breaks  DefectDojo\u0026rsquo;s reports can be generated in HTML and AsciiDoc.\nIssue Consolidation DefectDojo allows users to automatically consolidate issues from multiple scanners to remove duplicates.\nTo enable this feature, hover over the configuration tab on the left menu and click on system settings. In system settings, click 'Deduplicate findings'. Click 'Submit' at the bottom of the page.\nWhen deduplication is enabled, Dojo will compare CWE, title, and endpoint details for all findings in a given product. If an issue is added with either the CWE or title being the same while the endpoint is also the same, Dojo marks the old issue as a duplicate.\nFalse Positive Removal DefectDojo allows users to tune out false positives by enabling False Positive History. This will track what engineers have labeled as false positive for a specific product and for a specific scanner. While enabled, when a tool reports the same issue that has been flagged as a false positive previously, it will automatically mark the finding as a false positive, helping to tune overly verbose security tools.\nDeduplication Deduplication is a process that allows DefectDojo to find out that a finding has already been imported.\nUpon saving a finding, defectDojo will look at the other findings in the product or the engagement (depending on the configuration) to find duplicates\nWhen a duplicate is found:\n The newly imported finding takes status: inactive, duplicate An \u0026quot;Original\u0026quot; link is displayed after the finding status, leading to the original finding  There are two ways to use the deduplication:\n   Deduplicate vulnerabilities in the same build/release. The vulnerabilities may be found by the same scanner (same scanner deduplication) or by different scanners (cross-scanner deduplication). : - this helps analysis and assessment of the technical debt, especially if using many different scanners; although detecting duplicates across scanners is not trivial as it requires a certain standardization.     Track unique vulnerabilities across builds/releases so that defectDojo knows when it finds a vulnerability whether it has seen it before. : - this allows you keep information attached to a given finding in a unique place: all further duplicate findings will point to the original one.  Deduplication Configuration Global configuration The deduplication can be activated in \u0026quot;System Settings\u0026quot; by ticking \u0026quot;Deduplicate findings\u0026quot;.\nAn option to delete duplicates can be found in the same menu, and the maximum number of duplicates to keep for the same finding can be configured.\nEngagement configuration When creating an engagement or later by editing the engagement, the \u0026quot;Deduplication within engagement only\u0026quot; checkbox can be ticked.\n If activated: Findings are only deduplicated within the same engagement. Findings present in different engagements cannot be duplicates Else: Findings are deduplicated across the whole product  Note that deduplication can never occur across different products.\nDeduplication algorithms The behavior of the deduplication can be configured for each parser in settings.dist.py (or settings.py after install) by configuring the [DEDUPLICATION_ALGORITHM_PER_PARSER]{.title-ref} variable.\nThe available algorithms are:\n   [DEDUPE\\_ALGO\\_UNIQUE\\_ID\\_FROM\\_TOOL]{.title-ref} : - the deduplication occurs based on finding.unique\\_id\\_from\\_tool which is a unique technical id existing in the source tool. Few scanners populate this field currently. If you want to use this algorithm, you may need to update the scanner code beforehand - Advantages: : - If your source tool has a reliable means of tracking a unique vulnerability across scans, this configuration will allow defectDojo to use this ability - Drawbacks: : - Using this algorithm will not allow cross-scanner deduplication as other tools will have a different technical id. - When the tool evolves, it may change the way the unique id is generated. In that case you won\\'t be able to recognise that findings found in previous scans are actually the same as the new findings.     [DEDUPE\\_ALGO\\_HASH\\_CODE]{.title-ref} : - the deduplication occurs based on finding.hash\\_code. The hash\\_code itself is configurable for each scanner in parameter [HASHCODE\\_FIELDS\\_PER\\_SCANNER]{.title-ref}     [DEDUPE\\_ALGO\\_UNIQUE\\_ID\\_FROM\\_TOOL\\_OR\\_HASH\\_CODE]{.title-ref} : - a finding is a duplicate with another if they have the same unique\\_id\\_from\\_tool OR the same hash\\_code - Allows to use both : - a technical deduplication (based on unique\\_id\\_from\\_tool) for a reliable same-parser deduplication - and a functional one (based on hash\\_code configured on CWE+severity+file\\_path for example) for cross-parser deduplication     [DEDUPE\\_ALGO\\_LEGACY]{.title-ref} : - This is algorithm that was in place before the configuration per parser was made possible, and also the default one for backward compatibility reasons. - Legacy algorithm basically deduplicates based on: : - For static scanner: \\[\\'title\\', \\'cwe\\', \\'line\\', \\'file\\_path\\', \\'description\\'\\] - For dynamic scanner: \\[\\'title\\', \\'cwe\\', \\'line\\', \\'file\\_path\\', \\'description\\', \\'endpoints\\'\\] - Note that there are some subtleties that may give unexpected results. Switch [dojo.specific-loggers.deduplication]{.title-ref} to debug in settings.py to get more info in case of trouble.  Hash_code computation configuration The hash_code computation can be configured for each parser using the parameter [HASHCODE_FIELDS_PER_SCANNER]{.title-ref} in settings.dist.py.\nThe parameter [HASHCODE_ALLOWED_FIELDS]{.title-ref} list the fields from finding table that were tested and are known to be working when used as a hash_code. Don't hesitate to enrich this list when required (the code is generic and allows adding new fields by configuration only)\nNote that [endpoints]{.title-ref} isn't a field from finding table but rather a meta value that will trigger a computation based on all the endpoints.\nWhe populating [HASHCODE_FIELDS_PER_SCANNER]{.title-ref}, please respect the order of declaration of the fields: use the same order as in [HASHCODE_ALLOWED_FIELDS]{.title-ref} : that will allow cross-scanner deduplication to function because the hash_code is computed as a sha-256 of concatenated values of the configured fields.\nTips:\n  It's advised to use fields that are standardized for a reliable deduplication, especially if aiming at cross-scanner deduplication. For example [title]{.title-ref} and [description]{.title-ref} tend to change when the tools evolve and don't allow cross-scanner deduplication\n  Good candidates are\n: - cwe or cve - Adding the severity will make sure the deduplication won't be to aggressive (there are several families of XSS and sql injection for example, with various severities but the same cwe). - Adding the file_path or endpoints is advised too.\n  The parameter [HASHCODE_ALLOWS_NULL_CWE]{.title-ref} will allow switching to legacy algorithm when a null cwe is found for a given finding: this is to avoid getting many duplicates when the tool fails to give a cwe while we are expecting it.\n  Hashcode generation / regeneration When you change the hashcode configuration, it is needed to regenerated the hashcodes for all findings, or at least those findings found by scanners for which the configuration was updated.\nThis is sometimes also needed after an upgrade to a new Defect Dojo version, for example when we made changes to the hashcode configuration or calculation logic. We will mention this in the upgrade notes.\nTo regenerate the hashcodes, use the dedupe management command:\ndocker-compose exec uwsgi ./manage.py dedupe --hash_code_only  This will only regenerated the hashcodes, but will not run any deduplication logic on existing findings. If you want to run deduplication again on existing findings to make sure any duplicates found by the new hashcode config are marked as such, run\ndocker-compose exec uwsgi ./manage.py dedupe  The deduplication part of this command will run the deduplication for each finding in a celery task. If you want to run the deduplication in the foreground process, use:\ndocker-compose exec uwsgi ./manage.py dedupe --dedupe-sync  Please note the deduplication process is resource intensive and can take a long time to complete (estimated ~7500 findings per minute when run in the foreground)\nDebugging deduplication There is a specific logger that can be activated in order to have details about the deduplication process : switch [dojo.specific-loggers.deduplication]{.title-ref} to debug in settings.py.\nDeduplication - APIv2 parameters  [skip_duplicates]{.title-ref} : if true, duplicates are not inserted at all [close_old_findings]{.title-ref} : if true, findings that are not duplicates and that were in the previous scan of the same type (example ZAP) for the same product (or engagement in case of \u0026quot;Deduplication on engagement\u0026quot;) and that are not present in the new scan are closed (Inactive, Verified, Mitigated)  Service Level Agreement (SLA) DefectDojo allows you to maintain your security SLA and automatically remind teams whenever a SLA is about to get breached, or breaches.\nSimply indicate in the System Settings for each severity, how many days teams have to remediate a finding.\nSLA notification configuration There are 5 variables in the settings.py file that you can configure, to act on the global behavior. By default, any findings across the instance that are in Active, Verified state will be considered for notifications.\nSLA_NOTIFY_ACTIVE = False SLA_NOTIFY_ACTIVE_VERIFIED_ONLY = True SLA_NOTIFY_WITH_JIRA_ONLY = False SLA_NOTIFY_PRE_BREACH = 3 SLA_NOTIFY_POST_BREACH = 7 Setting both SLA_NOTIFY_ACTIVE and SLA_NOTIFY_ACTIVE_VERIFIED_ONLY to False will effectively disable SLA notifications.\nYou can choose to only consider findings that have a JIRA issue linked to them. If so, please set SLA_NOTIFY_WITH_JIRA_ONLY to True.\nThe SLA_NOTIFY_PRE_BREACH is expressed in days. Whenever a finding's \u0026quot;SLA countdown\u0026quot; (time to remediate) drops to this number, a notification would be sent everyday, as scheduled by the crontab in settings.py, until the day it breaches.\nThe SLA_NOTIFY_POST_BREACH lets you define in days how long you want to be kept notified about findings that have breached the SLA. Passed that number, notifications will cease.\nBe mindful of performance if you choose to have SLA notifications on non-verified findings, especially if you import a lot of findings through CI in 'active' state.\n What notification channels for SLA notifications? The same as usual. You will notice that an extra [SLA breach]{.title-ref} option is now present on the Notification page and also in the Product view.\nSLA notification with JIRA You can choose to also send SLA notification as JIRA comments, if your product is configured with JIRA. You can enable it at the JIRA configuration level or at the Product level.\nThe Product level JIRA notification configuration takes precendence over the global JIRA notification configuration.\nWhen is the SLA notification job run?

Here he sets some basic information, like how long he expects the Engagement will take, who will be leading the testing (himself), what Product he will be working on, and what tests he will be doing.\nNext, he can add a Test to the Engagement, or upload a Nessus scan and start picking out the real vulnerabilities from the false positives (Nessus scan Findings are imported as inactive by default).\nWithin the Test section, Bill can add Findings for any issues that he has uncovered during his audit. He can assign a severity to the Findings, describe replication steps, mitigation strategies, and impact on the system. This will come in handy when he wants to generate a report to send to the development team responsible for this Product, or his manager.\nOnce Bill has completed his Engagement, he can close the Engagement on the main Engagement page. He can then view the results of his Tests, and generate a report to send to the development team.\nIf Bill hears back from the development team that they won't be able to fix the issue for a while, he can make a note of this on the Engagement page. Bill will also receive Alerts for any bugs that persist longer than they are supposed to based on their severity.\nExample 2 - John the QE manager John wants to keep tabs on what his team members are up to, and find issues that are taking a long time to get fixed. He creates his own DefectDojo account with superuser privileges so that he can view other team members' metrics.\nTo get a better idea of what his team members are currently working on, he can start by checking the Calendar. This will show him any active Engagements that his team is involved in, based on the dates assigned to those Engagements.\nHe can view metrics for a Product Type, such as \u0026quot;Third Party Apps\u0026quot; to track his team's activity and follow up with Product teams who have long-lived bugs. He can also look at all the Findings for which there is a Risk Acceptance associated, and ensure that the proper documentation or timeline has been provided for the Findings in question.\nIf he wants to check on a particular team member's progress, he can look at the Engineer Metrics dashboard under \u0026quot;Additional Metrics\u0026quot; for that user.\n"},{"uri":"https://DefectDojo.github.io/django-DefectDojo/running/","title":"Running DefectDojo","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Running DefectDojo Running DefectDojo.\n Getting Started     Configuration     Running in Production     Upgrading     "},{"uri":"https://DefectDojo.github.io/django-DefectDojo/contributing/","title":"Contributing","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Contributing  Branching Model     Documentation     How to write a DefectDojo parser     "},{"uri":"https://DefectDojo.github.io/django-DefectDojo/contributing/branching-model/","title":"Branching Model","tags":[],"description":"","content":"The DefectDojo team aims to release at least once a month, on the last Tuesday.

DefectDojo is a security tool that automates application security vulnerability management. DefectDojo streamlines the application security testing process by offering features such as importing third party security findings, merging and de-duping, integration with Jira, templating, report generation and security metrics.\nWhat does DefectDojo do? While traceability and metrics are the ultimate end goal, DefectDojo is a bug tracker at its core. Taking advantage of DefectDojo's Product:Engagement model, enables traceability among multiple projects and test cycles, and allows for fine-grained reporting.\nHow does DefectDojo work? DefectDojo is based on a model that allows the ultimate flexibility in your test tracking needs.\n Working in DefectDojo starts with a Product Type. Each Product Type can have one or more Products. Each Product can have one or more Engagements. Each Engagement can have one or more Tests. Each Test can have one or more Findings.  The code is open source, and available on github and a running example is available on the demo server using the credentials admin / defectdojo@demo#appsec.

Checkout dev and make sure you\u0026rsquo;re up to date with the latest changes. It\u0026rsquo;s advised that you create a dedicated branch for your development, such as git checkout -b parser-name yet that\u0026rsquo;s up to you.  It is probably easier to use the docker-compose stack (and benefit from the hot-reload capbility for uWSGI). Set up your environment to use the dev or ptvsd environment, such as:\n$ docker/setEnv.sh dev or $ docker/setEnv.sh ptvsd (allows to set breakpoints in uWSGI)\nPlease have a look at DOCKER.md for more details.\ndocker images You\u0026rsquo;d want to build your docker images locally, and eventually pass in your local user\u0026rsquo;s uid to be able to write to the image (handy for database migration files). Assuming your user\u0026rsquo;s uid is 1000, then:\n$ docker-compose build --build-arg uid=1000\nWhich files do you need to modify?    File Purpose     dojo/tools/\u0026lt;parser_dir\u0026gt;/__init__.py Empty file for class initialization   dojo/tools/\u0026lt;parser_dir\u0026gt;/parser.py The meat. This is where you write your actual parser   dojo/unittests/scans/\u0026lt;parser_dir\u0026gt;/{many_vulns,no_vuln,one_vuln}.json Sample files containing meaningful data for unit tests. The minimal set.    Template Generator Utilze the template parser to quickly generate the files required. To get started you will need to install cookiecutter.\n$ pip install cookiecutter Then generate your scanner parser from the root of django-DefectDojo:\n$ cookiecutter https://github.com/DefectDojo/cookiecutter-scanner-parser Read more on the template configuration variables.\nThings to pay attention to Parsers may have many fields, out of which many of them may be optional.\nAlways make sure you include checks to avoid potential KeyError errors (e.g. field does not exist), for those fields you are not absolutely certain will always be in file that will get uploaded. These translate to 500 error, and do not look good.\nUnit tests Each parser must have unit tests, at least to test for 0 vuln, 1 vuln and many vulns. You can take a look at how other parsers have them for starters. The more quality tests, the better.\nTest database To test your unit tests locally, you first need to grant some rights. Get your MySQL root password from the docker-compose logs, login as root and issue the following commands:\nMYSQL\u0026gt; grant all privileges on test_defectdojo.* to defectdojo@'%'; MYSQL\u0026gt; flush privileges; Run your tests This local command will launch the unit test for your new parser\n$ docker-compose exec uwsgi bash -c 'python manage.py test dojo.unittests.\u0026lt;your_unittest_py_file\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;main_class_name\u0026gt; -v2'\nExample for the blackduck hub parser:\n$ docker-compose exec uwsgi bash -c 'python manage.py test dojo.unittests.test_blackduck_csv_parser.TestBlackduckHubParser -v2'\nIf you want to run all unit tests, simply run $ docker-compose exec uwsgi bash -c 'python manage.py test dojo.unittests -v2'\n Other files that could be involved Change to the model In the event where you\u0026rsquo;d have to change the model, e.g. to increase a database column size to accomodate a longer string of data to be saved\n  Change what you need in dojo/models.py\n  Create a new migration file in dojo/db_migrations by running and including as part of your PR\n$ docker-compose exec uwsgi bash -c 'python manage.py makemigrations -v2'\n  Accept a different type of file to upload If you want to be able to accept a new type of file for your parser, take a look at dojo/forms.py around line 436 (at the time of this writing) or locate the 2 places (for import and re-import) where you find the string attrs={\u0026quot;accept\u0026quot;:.\nFormats currently accepted: .xml, .csv, .nessus, .json, .html, .js, .zip.\nA need for more than just the parser.py Of course, nothing prevents you from having more files than the parser.py file.

If the \u0026quot;companies\u0026quot; field is not present, and filtering is still requested, the \u0026quot;filters\u0026quot; field can be used to filter all findings across all companies. It carries the same behavior as the company filters. The \u0026quot;filters\u0026quot; field is disregarded in the prescense of the \u0026quot;companies\u0026quot; field.

This file can be modified to your needs, rebuild all containers afterwards. There\u0026rsquo;s also a more limited template available, which can be chosen when configuring a JIRA Instance or JIRA Project for a Product or Engagement:\nAny folder added to dojo/templates/issue-trackers/ will be added to the dropdown (after rebuilding/restarting the containers).\nEngagement Epic Mapping \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;..\nIf creating an Engagement, ensure to tick \u0026lsquo;Enable engagement epic mapping\u0026rsquo; if desired. This can also be done after engagement creation on the edit engagement page. This will create an \u0026lsquo;Epic\u0026rsquo; type issue within Jira. All findings in the engagement pushed to Jira will have a link to this Epic issue. If Epic Mapping was enabled after associated findings have already been pushed to Jira, simply pushing them again will link the Jira issue to the Epic issue.\nPushing findings \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;.\nFindings can be pushed to Jira in a number of ways:\n When importing scanner reports, select \u0026lsquo;Push to JIRA\u0026rsquo; to push every single finding in the report to Jira When creating a new finding, select \u0026lsquo;Push to JIRA\u0026rsquo; and submit. This will create the finding in DefectDojo and Jira simultaneously If a finding already exist, visit the edit finding page and find the \u0026lsquo;Push to JIRA\u0026rsquo; tick box at the bottom When viewing a list of findings, select each relevant tick boxes to the left of the finding, and click the \u0026lsquo;Bulk Edit\u0026rsquo; button at the top. find \u0026lsquo;Push to JIRA\u0026rsquo; at the bottom of the menu  Status Sync\nDefectDojo will try to keep the status in sync with the status in JIRA using the Close and Reopen transition IDs configured for each JIRA instance. This will only work if your workflow in JIRA allows the Close transition to be performed from every status a JIRA issue can be in.\nKnown Issues\nThe Risk Acceptance feature in DefectDojo will (for that reason) not (yet) try to sync statuses. A comment will be pushed to JIRA if a finding is risk accepted or unaccepted. Contributions are welcome to enhance the integration.\nStatus reconciliation\nSometimes JIRA is down, or Defect Dojo is down, or there was bug in a webhook. In this case JIRA can become out of sync with Defect Dojo. If this is the case for lots of issues, manual reconciliation might not be feasible. For this scenario there is the management command \u0026lsquo;jira_status_reconciliation\u0026rsquo;.\nusage: manage.py jira_status_reconciliation [-h] [--mode MODE] [--product PRODUCT] [--engagement ENGAGEMENT] [--dryrun] [--version] [-v {0,1,2,3}] Reconcile finding status with JIRA issue status, stdout will contain semicolon seperated CSV results. Risk Accepted findings are skipped. Findings created before 1.14.0 are skipped. optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit --mode MODE - reconcile: (default)reconcile any differences in status between Defect Dojo and JIRA, will look at the latest status change timestamp in both systems to determine which one is the correct status - push_status_to_jira: update JIRA status for all JIRA issues connected to a Defect Dojo finding (will not push summary/description, only status) - import_status_from_jira: update Defect Dojo finding status from JIRA --product PRODUCT Only process findings in this product (name) --engagement ENGAGEMENT Only process findings in this product (name) --dryrun Only print actions to be performed, but make no modifications. -v {0,1,2,3}, --verbosity {0,1,2,3} Verbosity level; 0=minimal output, 1=normal output, 2=verbose output, 3=very verbose output This can be executed from the uwsgi docker container using:\n$ docker-compose exec uwsgi /bin/bash -c 'python manage.py jira_status_reconciliation' DEBUG output can be obtains via -v 3, but only after increasing the logging to DEBUG level in your settings.dist.py or local_settings.py file\n$ docker-compose exec uwsgi /bin/bash -c 'python manage.py jira_status_reconciliation -v 3' At the end of the command a semicolon seperated CSV summary will be printed. This can be captured by redirecting stdout to a file:\n$ docker-compose exec uwsgi /bin/bash -c 'python manage.py jira_status_reconciliation \u0026gt; jira_reconciliation.csv' Troubleshooting JIRA integration\nJIRA actions are typically performed in the celery background process. Errors are logged as alerts/notifications to be seen on the top right of the DefectDojo UI and in stdout of the celery workers.\n"},{"uri":"https://DefectDojo.github.io/django-DefectDojo/running/running-in-production/","title":"Running in Production","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Production with docker-compose The docker-compose.yml file in this repository is fully functional to evaluate DefectDojo in your local environment.\nAlthough Docker Compose is one of the supported installation methods to deploy a containerized DefectDojo in a production environment, the docker-compose.yml file is not intended for production use without first customizing it to your particular situation.\nDatabase performance and backup It is recommended to use a dedicated database server and not the preconfigured MySQL database. This will improve the performance of DefectDojo\nIn both case, if you use a dedicated database server or if you should decide to use the preconfigured MySQL database, make sure to make regular backups of the data. For a dedicated database server follow the instructions that come with the database server. For the preconfigured MySQL you can use mysqldump, e.g. as described in How to backup a Docker MySQL database.\nBackup of Media files Media files for uploaded files, including threat models and risk acceptance, are stored in a docker volume. This volume needs to be backed up regularly.\nInstance size Please read the paragraphs below about key processes tweaks.\n Having taken the database to run elsewhere, the minimum recommendation is:\n 2 vCPUs 8 GB of RAM 2 GB of disk space (remember, your database is not here -- so basically, what you have for your O/S should do). You could allocate a different disk than your OS's for potential performance improvements.  Key processes Per https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/pull/2813, it is now easy to somewhat improve the uWSGI and celery worker performance.\nuWSGI By default (except in ptvsd mode for debug purposes), uWSGI will handle 4 concurrent connections.\nBased on your resource settings, you can tweak:\n DD_UWSGI_NUM_OF_PROCESSES for the number of spawned processes. (default 2) DD_UWSGI_NUM_OF_THREADS for the number of threads in these processes. (default 2)  For example, you may have 4 processes with 6 threads each, yielding 24 concurrent connections.\nCelery worker By default, a single mono-process celery worker is spawned. This is fine until you start having many findings, and when async operations like deduplication start to kick in. Eventually, it will starve your resources and crawl to a halt, while operations continue to queue up.\nThe following variables will help a lot, while keeping a single celery worker container.\n DD_CELERY_WORKER_POOL_TYPE will let you switch to prefork. (default solo)  As you've enabled [prefork]{.title-ref}, the following variables have to be used. The default are working fairly well, see the Dockerfile.django for in-file references.\n DD_CELERY_WORKER_AUTOSCALE_MIN defaults to 2. DD_CELERY_WORKER_AUTOSCALE_MAX defaults to 8. DD_CELERY_WORKER_CONCURRENCY defaults to 8. DD_CELERY_WORKER_PREFETCH_MULTIPLIER defaults to 128.  You can execute the following command to see the configuration:\ndocker-compose exec celerybeat bash -c \u0026quot;celery -A dojo inspect stats\u0026quot; and see what is in effect.\nProduction with setup.bash From this point down, this page is slated to get a revamp\n This guide will walk you through how to setup DefectDojo for running in production using Ubuntu 16.04, nginx, and uwsgi.\nInstall, Setup, and Activate Virtualenv\nAssumes running as root or using sudo command for the below.\npip install virtualenv cd /opt virtualenv dojo cd /opt/dojo git clone https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo.git useradd -m dojo chown -R dojo /opt/dojo source ./bin/activate Install Dojo\nThe setup.bash installation method will be EOL on 2020-12-31\n cd django-DefectDojo/setup ./setup.bash Install Uwsgi\npip install uwsgi Install WKHTML\nfrom inside the django-DefectDojo/ directory execute:\n./reports.sh Disable Debugging\nUsing the text-editor of your choice, change DEBUG in django-DefectDojo/dojo/settings/settings.py to:\n`DEBUG = False` Configure external database\nIf you host your DefectDojo into AWS and you decide to use their managed database service (AWS RDS), you will have to do the following configuration updates:\n Download the root certificate to encrypt traffic between DefectDojo and the database Update your Dockerfile to add the SSL certificate to the container  COPY rds-ca-2019-root.pem /etc/ssl/certs/rds-ca-2019-root.pem Update Django settings to use encrypted connection to the database (Changes highlighted below)  DATABASES = { 'default': env.db('DD_DATABASE_URL') } DATABASES['default']['OPTIONS'] = { 'ssl': {'ca': '/etc/ssl/certs/rds-ca-2019-root.pem'} }   else:  DATABASES = {  'default': {\n     Update the environment variables for the database connection: DD_DATABASE_URL or DD_DATABASE_HOST, DD_DATABASE_PORT, DD_DATABASE_NAME, DD_DATABASE_USER and DD_DATABASE_PASSWORD.  Note: This configuration can be adapted to other cloud providers.\nStart Celery and Beats\nFrom inside the django-DefectDojo/ directory execute:\ncelery -A dojo worker -l info --concurrency 3 celery beat -A dojo -l info It is recommended that you daemonized both these processes with the sample configurations found here and here.\nHowever, for a quick setup you can use the following to run both in the background\ncelery -A dojo worker -l info --concurrency 3 \u0026amp; celery beat -A dojo -l info \u0026amp; Start Uwsgi\nFrom inside the django-DefectDojo/ directory execute:\nuwsgi --socket :8001 --wsgi-file wsgi.py --workers 7 It is recommended that you use an Upstart job or a @restart cron job to launch uwsgi on reboot. However, if you\u0026rsquo;re in a hurry you can use the following to run it in the background:\nuwsgi --socket :8001 --wsgi-file wsgi.py --workers 7 \u0026amp; Making Defect Dojo start on boot\nBelow we configure service files for systemd.

Google New to DefectDojo, a Google account can now be used for Authentication, Authorization, and a DefectDojo user. Upon login with a Google account, a new user will be created if one does not already exist. The criteria for determining whether a user exists is based on the users username. In the event a new user is created, the username is that of the Google address without the domain. Once created, the user creation process will not happen again as the user is recalled by its username, and logged in.

SAML 2.0 WARNING: The SAML integration below is based on https://github.com/fangli/django-saml2-auth which is no longer maintained, see #3890\nIn a similar direction OAuth, this SAML addition provides a more secure perogative to SSO. For definitions of terms used and more information, see the plugin plugin homepage\n Navigate to your SAML IdP and find your metadata Edit the dojo/settings.py file:    DD_SAML2_ENABLED=(bool, True), If the metadata can be accessed from a url, try the DD_SAML2_METADATA_AUTO_CONF_URL DD_SAML2_METADATA_AUTO_CONF_URL=(str, 'https://your_IdP.com/metadata.xml'), Otherwise, downlaod a copy of the metadata into an xml file, and list the path in DD_SAML2_METADATA_LOCAL_FILE_PATH DD_SAML2_METADATA_LOCAL_FILE_PATH=(str, '/path/to/your/metadata.xml'), Fill in DD_SAML2_ASSERTION_URL and DD_SAML2_ENTITY_ID to match the specs of you IdP. Configure the remaining optional fields to your desire.   In the \u0026quot;Authentication\u0026quot; section of the settings.py, do the following    Find the \u0026quot;SAML_2_AUTH\u0026quot; dictionary Comment out the metadata collection method that was not used. For example, if METADATA_AUTO_CONF_URL was used, comment the METADATA_LOCAL_FILE_PATH line.   Restart DefectDojo, and you should now see a Login with SAML button on the login page.  NOTE: In the case when IDP is configured to use self signed certificate, than CA needs to be specified by define environments variable REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE that points to the path of public CA certificate.\nUser Permissions  When a new user is created via the social-auth, the default permissions are only active. This means that the newly created user does not have access to add, edit, nor delete anything within DefectDojo. To circumvent that, a custom pipeline was added (dojo/pipline.py/modify_permissions) to elevate new users to staff. This can be disabled by setting \u0026lsquo;is_staff\u0026rsquo; equal to False. Similarly, for an admin account, simply add the following to the modify_permissions pipeline:  is_superuser = True\n  Exception for Gitlab OAuth2: with DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_GITLAB_PROJECT_AUTO_IMPORT set to True in dojo/settings.py, where a new user is created via the Gitlab social-auth, he has one permission: add_engagement. It allows him to create further engagements on his products via API v1.\nOther Providers In an effort to accommodate as much generality as possible, it was decided to implement OAuth2 with the social-auth ecosystem as it has a library of compatible providers with documentation of implementation. Conveniently, each provider has an identical procedure of managing the authenticated responses and authorizing access within a given application. The only difficulty is creating a new authentication client with a given OAuth2 provider.\n"},{"uri":"https://DefectDojo.github.io/django-DefectDojo/integrations/slack-notifications/","title":"Slack Notifications","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Scopes The following scopes have to be granted.\nToken The bot token has to be chosen and put in your System Settings\n"},{"uri":"https://DefectDojo.github.io/django-DefectDojo/running/upgrading/","title":"Upgrading","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Docker-compose When you deploy a vanilla docker-compose, it will create a persistent volume for your MySQL database.

Details of that PR: https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/pull/3136 Major JIRA integration refactoring, for which you should at least use 1.10.1 and not 1.10.0 for many bug fixes.  Breaking changes\nKubernetes/Helm users: we have moved away from the \u0026quot;stable\u0026quot; repository to \u0026quot;bitnami\u0026quot; in this release. The bitnami postgresql chart required us to add a new key to the postgresql secret, which will give you the error postgresql-postgres-password is missing if you have createPostgresqlSecret: false. In 1.10.1, a fix was also included to allow your existing postgresqlPassword to be reused properly.\nIncluding in 1.10.1 were a couple fixes related to a rabbitMQ upgrade. The path to access password, erlangCookie and existingPasswordSecret changed from rabbitmq to auth. Furthermore, as rabbitMQ is deployed as a StatefulSet, an in-place upgrade is not possible and an error will likely be thrown such as Forbidden: updates to statefulset spec for fields other than 'replicas', 'template', and 'updateStrategy' are forbidden. After ensuring your rabbitMQ celery queue is empty, you will then want to delete your rabbitMQ StatefulSet and PVC to allow them to get re-created, or fully delete and recreate defectdojo.\nUpgrading to DefectDojo Version 1.9.3 This is a security release\n See the security advisory See release notes  What's New:\n See release notes: https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases  NOTE:\nWhen upgrading from before 1.9.2, a corrective script may need to be ran\n[./manage.py create_endpoint_status]{.title-ref}\nIf you're using docker:\n[docker-compose exec uwsgi ./manage.py create_endpoint_status]{.title-ref}\nThis can take a while depending on your hardware and the number of findings in your instance.\n Search index tweaking index rebuild after upgrade:  This requires a (one-time) rebuild of the Django-Watson search index.
